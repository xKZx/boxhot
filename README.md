# boxhot
<h2>A heated enclosed Core XY FDM 3d printer. It is a box that is hot -> boxhot. </h2>

The design is a celebration to the fact that patents eventually do expire. 

So what do we have here:
1. Single direct extruder;
2. Linear guideways;
3. Fully enclosed insulated stainless steel heated chamber;
5. All motors outside of the box zone (hot in there, motors like to be cool);
6. 3 Z-axis stepper motors for real bed leveling;
7. Relatively easy to maintain;
8. Uses mostly off the shelf components, laser cut SS panels and 3030 aluminium extrusions. Estimated cost ~850.- Eur using china sourced components. 

First prototype currently in progress.

BOM and assembly documentation will follow after initial prototype.
